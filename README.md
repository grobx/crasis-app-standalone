# crasis

Crasis (/ˈkreɪsɪs/;[1] from the Greek κρᾶσις, "mixing", "blending")[2] is a type of contraction in which two vowels or diphthongs merge into one new vowel or diphthong—making one word out of two. Crasis occurs in Portuguese and Arabic as well as in Ancient Greek, where it was first described.
